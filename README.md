# Data-Science-Battle-of-Neighborhoods

## Introduction
New York City, known for its diverse demographics and large population, offers a fertile ground for various ethnic restaurants, including Japanese cuisine. With the increasing popularity of healthy eating habits, Japanese restaurants have gained traction as a healthy alternative to regular American food.
